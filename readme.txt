Create Member-Specific RSS Feeds for Paid Memberships Pro

== Description ==

RSS feeds, including those created by plugins like Blubrry PowerPress,
are filtered to hide member content. Enclosures, like mp3 URLs, are hidden as well.

All members are given a "memberkey" that can be attached to the end of a feed URL
that will allow access to the full member RSS feed.

E.g. of a feed URL with a member key:
http://www.yoursite.com/feed/podcast/?memberkey=58efacdc83d88e3edf8e31f4b4f5806e

There are no protections currently to keep users from sharing their feed URLs,
but future improvements could include monitoring use of the memberkeys and
deactivating ones that show signs of abuse.

Features:
* Create Member-Specific RSS Feeds for Paid Memberships Pro.
* View your RSS feeds on the Membership Account page.
* Add or remove as many RSS feed links as you want.

When the plugin is active, a link will be created under the Member Links section of every members' Membership Account page with the memberkey attached.
This special RSS feed will only contain membership restricted content which that user has access to, and filter out the rest (including unprotected posts).

Additional RSS feeds can be added with the pmpromrss_feeds filter. See example here: https://gist.github.com/messica/960b6365905a91a2a68b

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-member-rss` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
